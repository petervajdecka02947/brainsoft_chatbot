            #### Step 1: API Token Requirement
            - **First**, you'll need an **API token from OpenAI**. This token is essential for the application to access and utilize OpenAI's powerful AI models.

            #### Step 2: Model Selection
            - **Next**, choose an OpenAI model for your chatbot. We support models like **gpt-3.5-turbo-16k, gpt-4-1106-preview, and gpt-4**.
            - You can find more details about each model's capabilities, including their length, pricing, and other specifics at the [OpenAI Models Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/continuous-model-upgrades).

            #### Step 3: Source Selection for Interaction
            - **Choose a Source**:
                - **IBM Generative SDK**: Interact with the Generative AI Python SDK documentation.
                - **Other Files**: Engage with documents you upload (in PDF, TXT, CSV formats).

            #### Step 4: Chat and Explore
            - Once the model and source are set up, start chatting with the AI. Whether it's querying the SDK or discussing your uploaded documents, the AI is ready to assist."""

                - **Source Flexibility**: Independent of your source choice, the chatbot streams answers efficiently and accurately.
                - **Advanced Embeddings**: Uses 'text-embedding-ada-002' embeddings from OpenAI for nuanced understanding and information retireval.
                - **Transparency in Responses**: `At this version, the chatbot cites the source related to current question not chat history, ensuring clarity and trust.`
                - **Reset Option**: A 'Reset Conversation' feature allows you to start afresh anytime, storing each session independently in MongoDB.
                - **Web Lookups**: When using the 'IBM Generative SDK' source, the chatbot can perform specific web searches for additional information.
